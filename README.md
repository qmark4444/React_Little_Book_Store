# React_Little_Book_Store
first React project

This web app loads a list of books, and clicking a book leads to a modal showing details of the book. You have two options (buttons) either go back to the list or buy the book. Clicking BUY button will add the book to shopping cart and bring to cart page. The cart page shows all books you want to buy with title and quantity. Clicking Checkout button will bring you to a summary.

Building tool: webpack

Running command: npm start

[Version 1]
1. Books are hard-coded for mock testing, they will be later replaced by data in MongoDB and fetched by GraphQL
2. CSS is minimum, because the main purpose now is to learn how React and Redux work
